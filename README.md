# Jos North CDS Website

This repository contains a Next.js website for the Jos North Community Development Service (CDS) project. It's a modern, responsive site built with Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS and a small collection of UI primitives and components.

## Features
- Next.js 14 application (React 18)
- TypeScript-ready (project includes `tsconfig.json`)
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Reusable UI components under `components/` including Radix-based primitives
- Pages and sections for admin, events, developers, resources, and more

## Quickstart

Requirements:
- Node.js (18.x or newer recommended)
- npm (the project uses `npm` as the package manager)

Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Run development server:

```
npm run dev
```

Build for production:

```
npm run build
```

Start production server (after build):

```
npm run start
```

Notes: The project uses the `scripts` defined in `package.json` which map to Next.js commands (`dev`, `build`, `start`, `lint`).
